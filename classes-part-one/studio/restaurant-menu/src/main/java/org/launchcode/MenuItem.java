//"itemList" is assigned four things (hashmap name might be item)
//Lines 8-9: four key value pairs. Print category as list title. Print other three as item in list.
    //	• "name", "description", "price" = one item in the list
    //	• "category" (from an array of three items? also ArrayList is possible) = name of the list
//Print "menu" get category [0,1,2] display category name, item values
//dessert appetizer entree

//Two classes (done!)

//Menu - main (runner)
    //Setter and getters on Menu
    // grab category, for every one item, list name-description-price
    // title
    // hashmap that contains our public menu items
    // when run, main will print a menu with three categories of items
    // "at override" towards end of lecture 3 may help with new items (timing of menu publish)

//MenuItem
//Setters getters on Menu Item
    // add item and remove item
    // iterate over hashmap, select for category in order to print menu by category

//methods constructors
    //could be a hashmap Chapter 3 - Hashmap (last section) or exercises; research says quick retrieval
    // put() going to be our method to "add item" to menu
    // date class in Java may help with "new" menu items or when menu last published
